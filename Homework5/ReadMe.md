In **Homework 5**, I will create visualization using newly learned layouts discussed in class. A few layouts we learned include:
- *pie charts* 
- *donut charts*
-  *stacked bar* 
    - either *vertically* or *horizontally*
-  *stream graphs*

For this assignment, I will be utilizing a pie chart. 

As for the **dataset**, I will be working with data that I collected about my decision-making. I will be vizualizing this data to see which areas of my life I struggle making decisions with. The areas will be divided into:
- Personal
- Work
- Nurishment (food and drink)
- Social
- Shopping
