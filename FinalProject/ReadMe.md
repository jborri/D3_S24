For my *final project*, I would like to explore how the top best-selling books have changed over multiple decennial periods. 

I would like to explore which **genres**, the **length of the book**, and which **authors** are more prevalent, and how different they are every ten years.

 Interpreting this data could potentially *uncover particular trends* and preferences for aspiring writers as well as what is popular at each given time. It might even be possible to extrapolate this data to other cultural trends around the world.


The **interactive component** would be each **10-year period**. I am also considering extending the groupings to 20 or even 30 years if 10 years is too restrictive to observe any marginal differences.
